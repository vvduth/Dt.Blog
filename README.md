## Tech Stack
 * React Native 
## Credits
 * I use JSON and ngrok to store the data, so basically, no matters how many times you restart the app or reset the phone, the previous data will still there.
## Availability
 * I made this App by React Native, run with Expo CLI modules and simulate it both on my real device (Iphone 12) and Android Emulator.  :mobile_phone: 
 * This App can run on both IOS and Android system, but at the moment I do not have money to put it on the App Store or Google Play, so if you are an employer/ HR staff, please check a video demo below and hire me. :pleading_face:
