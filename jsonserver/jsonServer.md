To get this working, in this drectory you can run:

The server will run in port 3000 of local host [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. .<br />


The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run tunel`

This is the api I worked with. for each `npm run tunel` the API only works for 2 hours. If the API expired, Press CTRL + C and run the command again, the ngrok will give you a new API, all the Data still in the newone.
